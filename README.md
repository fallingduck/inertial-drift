# Inertial Drift

**Check the [releases](https://github.com/fallingduck/inertial-drift/releases)
for a Windows binary!**

This is a small game I developed in Python a few years ago. Although the
original objective was to familiarize myself with PyGame, by the end, I realized
that the game was actually halfway decent&mdash;and made in 48 hours (with an
intermission to go to school), no less!

Code is my own, and is licensed under the ISC License (see LICENSE file).

Music was composed by a friend of mine who goes by the moniker "JetStream." The
music is his property and he should be contacted about copyright issues (through
me, if necessary, I guess?).

The player and enemy sprites were drawn by another friend who goes by the
moniker [Magnie](https://github.com/magnie). Contact him about reusing his work.
